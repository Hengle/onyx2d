# onyx2d
C++ Engine for 2D Game Development

## Introduction

Onyx2d was a project started back in 2008 as a first approach to game engine development using OpenGL.
Along with OpenGL, this project uses the following libraries and APIs:
* OpenAL
* glut (freeglut)
* alut
* freeimage
* GLee
* vorbis

Bare in mind the following:
<b>onyx2d uses OpenGL inmediate mode and is not recommended for modern game development.</b>

Although onyx2d is not the most optimized engine and was build from the unknowledge as a learing exercise, it works and is easy to understand and use.

## Setup

The engine has been developed mainly in Code::Blocks so it is quite easy to get it up and running using that IDE.

#### Code::Blocks configuration
1. Import the project onyx_illusion.workspace located in the src/ folder into Code::Blocks
2. Activate sample_game project
3. Rebuild and execute

Hopefully you should be ready to go.
